📌 Player Starting Position

The player’s starting position is set using the Transform component in Unity.
By adjusting the X, Y, and Z values, we can control the player’s initial spawn position in the scene.

📌 Player Movement Logic

Player movement is controlled through a C# script.
The Update() method is used because:
It is called once per frame.
It provides smooth and real-time movement.

📌 Speed Control

The speed variable is declared as public so it can be adjusted directly from the Inspector.
Different speed values were tested:
Normal movement speed
Faster movement speed

🧠 Key Learnings

Speed control is essential for smooth frame-based movement.
